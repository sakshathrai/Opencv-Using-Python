# A cross-platform library, OpenCV facilitates image processing and analysis. In this course, you'll discover fundamental concepts related to computer vision and the basic operations which can be performed on images using OpenCV. You'll begin by outlining how to read images from your file system into your Python source in the form of arrays and then save an image array into a local file. Next, you'll explore color images represented as a combination of blue, green, and red channels, how to convert color images to grayscale, and how grayscale images are defined. Finally, you'll perform basic operations on images by investigating how to combine two images using an add operation and make one of the added images more prominent than the other using a weighted addition. Conversely, you'll also perform a subtract operation using two images.
